# PyOT2
PyOT2 intends to be a MMO game server framework written primarily in and for Python3.6+.

### Development, status & goals
PyOT2 is currently in early development.
It was started in mid August of 2018 and is only being developed by one person currently.
The actual development takes place on and source code resides in the developer's own personal computer.
Chunks of source code will be released in the /release directory in exchange for code contributions.

### Instructions / Directory structure
Basic development instructions/missions can be found in the /development directory.
In there you will find files that gives you a very basic and abstract idea of how some things currently works and what is missing/needed.

OT Protocol: 7.7 (more versions might be added later on)
