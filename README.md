# PyOT2
PyOT2 intends to be a MMO game server framework written primarily in and for Python3.6+.

### Development, status & goals
PyOT2 is currently in early development.
It was started in mid August of 2018 and is only being developed by one person currently.
The actual development and takes place on and source code resides in the developer's personal computer.

Currently no source code has been released.
Chunks of source code will be released in the /release directory in exchange for code contributions.
This precaution is being taken due to the high levels of mooching/profiting off other people's projects and low levels of development activity in the OpenTibia/Otland community, in addition to the creative and in the main developer's own opinion powerful nature of this project, reaching far and beyond what any OpenTibia project has even tried to do so far.
It is not a main goal of the developer to make this project open source, rather the goal is to finish the development of this project in the shortest amount of time possible and to pay back to contributors by either releasing chunks of source code or follow up on any other pre-agreed deals with any given contributor.

### Instructions / Directory structure
Basic development instructions/missions can be found in the /development directory.
In there you will find files that gives you a very basic and abstract idea of how some things currently works and what is missing/needed.

OT Protocol: 7.7 (more versions might be added later on)
