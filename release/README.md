# PyOT2
PyOT2 intends to be a MMO game server framework written primarily in and for Python3.6+.

### Development
PyOT2 is currently in early development. It was started in mid August of 2018 and has been and is still currently developed by a solo developer.
Development takes place on the developer's own computer.
Currently none of the source code has been released.
Chunks of source code will be released in the /release directory equal to and in exchange for code contributions.
This precaution is being taken due to the high levels of mooching/profiting off other people's projects and low levels of development activity in the OpenTibia/Otland community in addition to the creative and in the main developer's own opinion powerful nature of this project.
It is not a main goal of the developer to make this project open source, it is rather to finish the development of this project in the shortest time-frame possible and to pay back to any volunteers what they have contributed by either releasing chunks of source code or follow up on any other pre-agreed deals with a given volunteer.

### Instructions / Directory structure
Basic development instructions/missions can be found in the /development directory.
In there you will find files that gives you a very basic and abstract idea of how things currently works and what is missing/needed.

OT Protocol: 7.7 (more versions might be added later on)
